Paged File Manager Class
- This class is used to open/close/create/delete a file.  It is also used to print out FileHandle
statistics, read a complete page, and write a complete page. 

Record Based File Manager Class
- This class has the same open/close/create/delete functions, but simply calls the Paged File Manager
class to handle these interactions.  From there it also has insert/read/print record functions. 

- Print simply iterates through the data, and prints out the attribute and its respective value.

- Read will navigate to the correct page, the using the page's directory, find the correct record
using the offset in the directory.

- Insert is a little more complicated than these two functions.  Insert will attempt to insert a record
from the last page, and if it cannot insert it into the last page, it will go backwards towards the front page
until it is possibly able to insert it into a page.  If unable to insert into a page, a new page will be appended
to the file, with this newly inserted record.
